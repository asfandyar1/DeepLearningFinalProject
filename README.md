# Deep Learning Final Project
## Vehicle Localization and Classification

The objective of this project is to implement a Deep Learning application for localizing and classifying vehicles in images. The deep learning model is trained over labeled data of vehicles (cars, motorcycles), where the labels consist on the bounding boxes of the vehicle in the image and the type of vehicle.

We trained the model using the UFPR-ALPR dataset, which can be obtained following https://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/ufpr-alpr/license-agreement/

## Data processing

The script dataloader.py allows to generate a single file with all samples in a folder of the dataset, loading images in png format and labels written in txt files. It also gives the option of resizing the images and labels to a given resolution. To get more information run:
````
training.py -h
````

## Training

To train a model and store it to a file, along with information about the training loss, run script training.py. To get more information run:
````
dataloader.py -h
````

## Visualizing

The functions for visualizing bounding boxes generated by the model are included in the visualize.py file.
